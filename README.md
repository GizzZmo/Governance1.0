# Governance System Enhancement Strategy

This repository outlines a strategy for enhancing a Move-based blockchain governance system. It includes modular smart contracts for key governance functions, such as:

- **Quadratic + Adaptive Governance:** Enabling nuanced and Sybil-resistant voting.
- **Delegation & Staking:** Managing validator reputation and network security.
- **Treasury Multi-sig Management:** Facilitating secure and transparent fund allocation.
- **Proposal Handling:** Streamlining the execution of governance decisions.

## Key Components

- **`/contracts`:** Contains the Move smart contracts implementing the governance logic.
- **`/tests`:** Includes unit and integration tests for the smart contracts.
- **`/scripts`:** Provides utility scripts for deployment and interaction.
- **`/docs`:** Offers documentation on the system architecture, specifications, and usage.
- **`/config`:** Holds configuration files for network parameters.

## Enhancement Focus

This project aims to implement the following key enhancements:

1.  **Refined Validator Reputation Scoring:** Implementing a more comprehensive system to evaluate and reward validator performance and reliability.
2.  **DAO Integration:** Introducing governance tokens and token-weighted voting to further decentralize decision-making.
3.  **Treasury AI Audits:** Exploring the integration of AI-driven analysis for enhanced security and risk assessment of treasury proposals.

## Getting Started

Detailed instructions on how to deploy and interact with these contracts can be found in the [README.md](README.md) and [docs](docs) directory.
